# Points Reward on Ticket Purchase

## Implementation

Added automatic points reward when users purchase tickets from events.

## Changes Made

### Frontend - Events.tsx

Added points recording after successful ticket purchase in [Events.tsx](../frontend/src/pages/Events.tsx#L80-L95):

```typescript
// Record activity for points
try {
  const result = await recordActivity(
    wallet.publicKey.toString(),
    'TICKET_PURCHASED',
    tx,
    { eventName: selectedEvent.name }
  )

  if (result.success && result.pointsEarned > 0) {
    toast.success(`+${result.pointsEarned} points earned!`)
  }
} catch (activityError) {
  console.error('Failed to record activity:', activityError)
  // Don't fail the flow if points recording fails
}
```

## Activity Type

- **Activity**: `TICKET_PURCHASED`
- **Display Name**: "Ticket Purchased"
- **Emoji**: üõí
- **Points**: Configured in backend API

## User Experience

When a user purchases a ticket:

1. ‚úÖ Ticket is minted and transferred to user
2. ‚úÖ Payment is sent to event organizer
3. ‚úÖ Transaction success message shown
4. ‚úÖ Points are automatically awarded
5. ‚úÖ Bonus toast: "+X points earned!"
6. ‚úÖ User level may increase

## Example Flow

```
User clicks "Buy Ticket"
  ‚Üì
buy_event_ticket() executes
  ‚Üì
‚úÖ Transaction succeeds
  ‚Üì
recordActivity('TICKET_PURCHASED', ...)
  ‚Üì
‚úÖ Backend records activity + awards points
  ‚Üì
Toast: "Ticket purchased successfully!"
Toast: "+50 points earned!" üéâ
```

## Error Handling

- If points recording fails, the ticket purchase is **NOT** rolled back
- Points are a bonus feature - ticket purchase is the primary goal
- Errors are logged but don't affect the user flow
- User still gets their ticket even if points fail

## Backend Integration

The points system is managed by the Level API:
- Endpoint: `/api/activities`
- Method: `POST`
- Body:
  ```json
  {
    "walletAddress": "...",
    "activityType": "TICKET_PURCHASED",
    "transactionSignature": "...",
    "metadata": {
      "eventName": "Concert XYZ"
    }
  }
  ```

## Complete Activity Types

The system tracks multiple activities:

| Activity | Points | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `EVENT_CREATED` | TBD | Create a new event |
| `TICKET_MINTED` | TBD | Mint a ticket (organizers) |
| `TICKET_PURCHASED` | TBD | Buy a ticket (users) ‚≠ê NEW |
| `TICKET_SCANNED` | TBD | Ticket scanned at event |
| `TICKET_COLLECTIBLE` | TBD | Upgrade to collectible |

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Gamification**: Rewards users for participating
‚úÖ **Engagement**: Encourages more ticket purchases
‚úÖ **Progress**: Helps users level up
‚úÖ **Non-Blocking**: Doesn't interfere with core functionality
‚úÖ **Transparent**: Users see points earned immediately

## Testing

1. Connect wallet
2. Navigate to Events page
3. Click "Buy Ticket" on any event
4. Confirm transaction
5. Observe toasts:
   - "Ticket purchased successfully!"
   - "+X points earned!"
6. Check profile to see updated points total

## Notes

- Points are awarded **after** successful on-chain transaction
- Points are tied to the transaction signature (prevents duplicates)
- Users can view their activity history in their profile
- Points accumulate across all activities
- Leveling system is managed by backend API
